								<h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
								<p>My teaching philosophy is heavily focused around differentiation and the understanding that every student is different and learns differently. 
									I find this is one of the greatest challenges in this career in that having to focus on one student with high needs means the remainder of the class may not get the support they need. To me This is why it's such an important component of teaching as if he isn't appropriately considered in practise, they can be detrimental effects on a student's education.</p>

								<p>Being a secondary education teacher I have a slightly different perspective on teaching especially in later years of their educational journey, while studying, learning and applying skills in both practical and exam formats is important I believe the exposure to many different subject areas is what has the greatest impact on the students life. 
									Through their secondary education a student is given the chance to explore many different subject areas and find what they have passion for, this can allow them to pursue a future career and help their decision in the area of work they wish to join. With this in mind a big part of my teaching philosophy is facilitating opportunity for students to explore and learn about different things in an aim to discover what they have a passion for, often I find this leads to better results in the students academic work as they are studying a topic area they enjoy learning about.</p>

								<h4>My Teaching Approach</h4>
								<p>Everyone is a different learner and has a different way of learning, a teacher should identify these preferences and integrate them into their lessons. For example I find the constructivist method to be my preferred format of learning, it gives context to what you're learning about the whole purpose or end result is shown and it focuses on social 
									learning with hands on activities in which the students are allowed to explore the content rather than be shown. The embedded video provides an in-depth explanation. If embeded video does not work please used links available in the list.</p>

									</div>
								<p>I see being a teacher as a constant journey of learning and developing my own craft and abilities in all areas relevant to me, considering I've learned so much in just a short amount of time I'm excited to apply my learning, reflect on experience and become a better teacher.</p>
