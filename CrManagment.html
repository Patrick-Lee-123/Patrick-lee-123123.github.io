								<h3>Behaviour management</h3><br>
								<p>Regarding behaviour management I like to establish rules for the class and ensure all students are know the expectations for both their behaviour and learning. I make an effort to ensure there no ambiguity in the rules and that they are fair, through this I will constantly enforce the 9 rules but will not reprimand for genuine confusion and misunderstanding.
                                    I also know that once students see poor behaviour is acceptable Paula teacher they take advantage of this and increase poor behaviour, this highlights the importance of shutting down bad behaviour early.
                                    </p>

                                <h3>Class room management</h3>
								<p>My personal perspective is that no one likes to be yelled at, rarely have I seen a situation where it has been more helpful and in something I take pride in to not communicate to my students in that way. Rather I prefer to separate them from the source of the behaviour issues, often I will give them time alone to calm down before I have a conversation with them disclosing the issues and ensuring they understand what was wrong.
                                    Regarding classroom management I like the contract card system, typically this is integrated across the whole school however it can be effective in classroom level. This contract system allows the teacher to make the expectations very clear to the students and they can construct consequences an rewards with the teacher so they feel it is fair and understandable. This also gives these students a chance to disclose their personal feelings which can reveal the source of behaviour problems.
                                    </p>
